The goal is to have all of the assets in your project be webpack's concern and not the browser's (though, to be clear, this doesn't mean that they all have to be bundled together). webpack treats every file (.css, .html, .scss, .jpg, etc.) as a module. However, webpack itself only understands JavaScript.

Loaders in webpack transform these files into modules as they are added to your dependency graph.

At a high level, loaders have two purposes in your webpack config. They work to:

Identify which file or files should be transformed by a certain Loader. (test property)
Transform those files so that they can be added to your dependency graph (and eventually your bundle). (use property)

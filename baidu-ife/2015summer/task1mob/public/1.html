        webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often only one - to be loaded by the browser.

        It is incredibly configurable, but to get started you only need to understand Four Core Concepts: entry, output, loaders, and plugins.

        This document is intended to give a high-level overview of these concepts, while providing links to detailed concept specific use cases.

        webpack creates a graph of all of your application's dependencies. The starting point of this graph is known as an entry point. The entry point tells webpack where to start and follows the graph of dependencies to know what to bundle. You can think of your application's entry point as the contextual root or the first file to kick off your app.

        In webpack we define entry points using the entry property in our webpack configuration object.

        The simplest example is seen below:

        webpack.config.js

        module.exports = {
          entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js'
        };
        There are multiple ways to declare your entry property that are specific to your application's needs.
